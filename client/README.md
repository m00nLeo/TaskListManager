TaskListManager is a simple yet powerful to-do list management system built using React. It provides an intuitive drag-and-drop task sorting, pagination for managing multiple pages of tasks, task status tracking (completed/incomplete), and various utilities for editing and deleting tasks. This project allows you to easily create, update, delete, and manage your tasks in an efficient way.
